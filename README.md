## FIND PACKAGE USING REINFORCEMENT LEARNING

 agent moves boxes in a grid-world environment called Four-Rooms.

# How to run the Program

# must have :
numpy
plotly
matplotlib



$ make  # build virtual environment
$ make Scenario1  
    # Run Scenario1
$ make Scenario2  
    # Run Scenario2
$ make Scenario3  
    # Run Scenario3

# First Scenario
In the first scenario, the agent must collect one package located somewhere in the environment.

# Second Scenario
The second scenario requires the agent to collect three packages located throughout the environment.

# Third Scenario
For the third scenario, the agent must collect three packages, marked as red (R), green (G), and blue (B), respectively, in that order. Incorrectly collecting a package will end the simulation epoch prematurely.
